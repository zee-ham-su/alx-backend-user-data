# 0x01. Basic Authentication

This repository contains code examples and explanations for implementing basic authentication in a backend application.


## Introduction

In web development, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Basic authentication is a simple and widely supported method for implementing user authentication in HTTP-based applications.

This repository provides examples and step-by-step guides on how to implement basic authentication in different programming languages and frameworks.

## Resources
- Read or watch:

- (REST API Authentication Mechanisms) - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=501dpx2IjGY]
- (Base64 in Python) [https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/base64.html]
- (HTTP header Authorization) [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization]
- (Flask) [https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/]
- (Base64 - concept) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64]

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Knowledge of the programming language or framework you are using
- Basic understanding of HTTP and web development concepts
- Development environment set up with the necessary tools and dependencies

## Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- General
- What authentication means
- What Base64 is
- How to encode a string in Base64
- What Basic authentication means
- How to send the Authorization header

## Installation

To use the code examples in this repository, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zee-ham-su/alx-backend-user-data.git`
2. Install the required dependencies:`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the authentication settings: Update the configuration file with your desired settings

## Requirements
- Python Scripts
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
